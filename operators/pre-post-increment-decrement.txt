Pre-increment operator:

    When the operator come before the operand.

        ++i

    The operation increase the value of operand i, then
    evaluate the expression to the incremented value of the operand.

        var i = 1, j = ++i; // i and j are both 2

Post-increment operator:

    When the operator come after the operant.

       i++

    The operant is increase, but the expression is evaluated to
    the unincremented value of the operand.

        var i = 1, j = i++; // i is 2, j is 1



Because of JavaScript operator perform type coersion before operation,

        ++x and x=x+1

    don't always evaluate to the same value.

    For example, in the following, if x is of type number:

        var x = 1;
        ++x;         // 2

        var x = 1;
        x = x + 1;   // 2

    However, if x is of type string:

        var x = "1";
        ++x;         // 2

        var x = "1";
        x = x + 1;   // 11

    "+" concate string, while pre/post operator "++" does
    numeric addition operation.
