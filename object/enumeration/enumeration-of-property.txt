Enumerable properties:

    • Enumerable properties has their [[Enumeratble]] attribute set to true
    • When a properties is enumerable, it means they can be iterated with for-in loop
      and Object.keys() method
    • By default all properties that you add to an object are Enumerable

    Here is how you enumerate property on a object.

        var propertyName;
        for (propertyName in myObject) {
            // propertyName hold the name of preperty
        }

    Alternately you can obtain an array list of these names with:

        var PropertyNames = Object.keys(myOBject);  // <-- type array;

    Typically, you would use Object.keys() in situations where you
    want to operate on an array of property names and for-in when
    you don’t need an array.


    [!] Becareful though:

        for-in will also enumerates properties on prototype
        Objects.keys() array contains only object's own (instance) properties


Non Enumerable propeties:

    Enumerable properties has their [[Enumeratble]] attribute set to false.
    most native methods on objects are non-enumerable.

You can check whether a roperty is enumerable with

    Object.propertyIsEnumerable();
