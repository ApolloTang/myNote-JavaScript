    punctuation characters have special meanings in regular expressions:

        ^ $ .
        * + ?
        = ! : |
        \ /
        ( )
        [ ]
        { }

    If you want to include any of these punctuation characters
    literallly in a regular express, you mast escape it by precede
    them with a back slash

    If you canâ€™t remember exactly which punctuation characters
    need to be escaped with a backslash, you may safely place
    a backslash before any punctuation character.
